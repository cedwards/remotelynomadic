Much better!

You know, I'm glad I spent the first two days on what I'm not referring to as
the crappy side of the mountain. It makes me appreciate this that much more!

No washboard rutted roads. No bugs. No bushes made only of spikes. Ouch!

On Sunday afternoon I moved here to the Silver Island Mountains Dry Lake and
it's pretty cool. The earth is cracked and parched and it's barren for a huge
area. I can see brushland and mountains further in the distance but the Dry
Lake is like another world!

I'll be leaving here in the morning but I'll be back again.

The Silver Island Mountains Dry Lake is where I would stay again if I came back
here.
