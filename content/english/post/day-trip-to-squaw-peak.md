## Squaw Peak

Left early one morning and drove the van up here to Squaw Peak. It's an area
that overlooks the entire Provo Valley--pretty sure I could see my house from
up here!

The view was nice and being during the week and early in the day there weren't
many people around. A few hikers came through and a police officer patrolling
the mountain road. Otherwise it was a quiet place to sit and try to work.
Surprisingly the cell signal was not what I expected it to be up there. Very
low signal and not good enough to sustain a full day.

Went for a short hike up the trail where I was able to take the photo.
