 - Cape Disappointment (1 night)

## Cape Disappointment

This place was amazing. It was a very crowded camping area but I had a view of
the beach from the van and walked out into the surf in my sandals. While
otherss were in windbreakers and jackets I felt great in the 60 degree weather
at the beach. Nearly empty. Few other people. It was the most wide open free
space I'd experienced since locking down for COVID more than a year earlier.
