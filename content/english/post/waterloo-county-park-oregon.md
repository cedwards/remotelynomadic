## Battle Ground

Drove 14 hours to deliver Trevor to Portland and then on to Barry's house. That
bastard wasn't even home when I arrived. It's fine. He warned me. Fell asleep
late, exhausted, and didn't sleep great. This was my first experience with the
cold weather and the inflatable air mattress.

## Hood River

Visited with grandparents. Last time seeing grandpa before he passed (see other
post). Caught up with cousins, aunts and uncles that I haven't seen in years
and years.

## Battle Ground Lake

This was a great place to spend a day at work. I had meetings much of the day
but I did them from out in the forrest. Seem to recall I turned off the camera
on the Zoom call and spent the time cleaning and organizing the van for the
day. Man that job had a lot of pointless meetings. Spent the day charging the
batteries and preparing to drive to the coast.

## Cape Disappointment

This place was amazing. It was a very crowded camping area but I had a view of
the beach from the van and walked out into the surf in my sandals. While
otherss were in windbreakers and jackets I felt great in the 60 degree weather
at the beach. Nearly empty. Few other people. It was the most wide open free
space I'd experienced since locking down for COVID more than a year earlier.

## Waterloo State Park

Small RV park that I found not far from Cooper's house in Lebanon. Haven't
talked to him in years either and it was good to catch up. Don't believe I have
any pictures from the visit with him but I do have a handful from the park. It
was not bad. Just one night but just like most other places on this trip, too
close to too many people.

## Baker City

Ended up spending the final night in Baker City in a driveway. Had indended to
bunker down at a rest area about an hour short of there but after I got an
offer for a house to stay at I parked in the driveway and slept there. Quick
stay. Nothing to see. Met some relatives on my wife's side and then back to
driving.
