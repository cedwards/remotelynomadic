## Father's Day

On this trip I forced The Boy to come with me. I told him the main thing I
wanted for Father's Day was to go camping with him. He reluctantly came with me
but was sure to bring his phone and his computer so that he had something to
do. First thing in the morning all he could ask about was when he could go
home. Ended up taking him back to down and heading back up the mountain myself.
