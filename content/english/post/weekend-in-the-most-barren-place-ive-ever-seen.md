### The Most Barren Place I've Ever Seen!

### Morning Meeting From a Rest Stop

### Mid-Day Meetings From Another Planet

### Higher Ground

It's difficult to describe how much of an event it is to see someone else until
you've spent hours or even days without seeing another soul. I've been out here
all day and have seen two vehicles. Just now, after dark, I see headlights
coming up the road. Who is this? Where are they going? I will admit to
sometimes wondering if I'll have an interaction with someone and what that
could mean out here away from everything.

Well the headlights came about halfway down the road and then turned around and
went back the way they came. Not for them I guess.

### Woke up to neighbors

### Two hours into the desert

### There and back again and never again

### Cinematic Sunrise

### Oops, Nevada
