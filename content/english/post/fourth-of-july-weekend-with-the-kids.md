## Camping With The Kiddos

This trip was three days without cell signal up past Ogden Utah on the way out
to Causey Reservoir. The kids had fun intertubing on the river with the
cousins. Grandma and Grandpa came with us and pushed through obvious exhaustion
to hang out with all the kids. By the end of it half were ready to go home and
half didn't want to leave.

The van made for a good hang out and that's where I cooked the meals for the
kids. My sister and her family cooked on the camp fire. Strange to say but I've
spent the season out camping a bunch and have not set any fires. I've got
light, heat and ability to cook in the van. Don't need to smell like smoke as
well.
