This was the inagural trip in my van to give things a try and see what worked.
Turned out to be a great trip and a fantastic start to the season!

It was early enough in the year that there were no bugs out yet. It was quiet
and peaceful. I was able to park at an angle to where I couldn't even see any
other campers either making it feel like a private escape.

This trip was short. Just overnight on Sunday and then back home Monday. Good
practice and I'd stay there again. Actually, I like the idea of making Antelope
Island my spring time inagural event each year.
