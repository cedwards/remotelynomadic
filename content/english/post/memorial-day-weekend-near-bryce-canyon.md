## Tom Best Spring Road

This turned out to be a great trip. Had a random encounter with my cousin
Thomas. Plus I spent a few days enjoying the quiet. Managed to get some good
exercise exploring the mountain roads as well. There are a couple more spots
I'd like to check out back there. In the meantime I've been trying to convince
CJ and the in-laws to head down there with me. Great area with tons of space to
spread out.

I'll go down here again.
