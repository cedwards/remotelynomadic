## Battle Ground Lake

This was a great place to spend a day at work. I had meetings much of the day
but I did them from out in the forrest. Seem to recall I turned off the camera
on the Zoom call and spent the time cleaning and organizing the van for the
day. Man that job had a lot of pointless meetings. Spent the day charging the
batteries and preparing to drive to the coast.
